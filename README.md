## üö¶ Installation

To install and run this project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Israel-Anaba/Embed_ML_Model_Web_App

# Change directory
cd Embed_ML_Model_Web_App

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## üöÄ Usage

Here's how you can use the project:

1. Access the web application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
2. Interact with the ML model through the user-friendly interface with features like the patients : Plasma glucose level,Body mass index,Blood pressure levels etc

## üìÑ Documentation

For detailed documentation and API usage, visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) after running the app locally.

## üì¶ Dockerization

First create a Dockerfile, check documention : [Docker Official Documentation - Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)


Dockerize the application with the following commands:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t app_name-app .

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 80:80 app_name-app
```

## üåê Deployment

The APP was further deployed on huggingface. You can interact with the app via huggingface following the steps below.
